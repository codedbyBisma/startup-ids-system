Cloud-Based Plug & Play Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A lightweight, real-time Intrusion Detection System built for small businesses and startups. Monitors network traffic, detects threats, stores logs in the cloud, and displays alerts on a live web dashboard.

Project Overview

This IDS was built as a freelance security project for a startup client. It provides real-time threat detection, cloud-based log storage, and a simple web dashboard — designed to be easy to deploy with no advanced technical knowledge required.

Features

Real-time network monitoring using Suricata IDS engine

Live alerts with severity levels (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)

Cloud logging via Firebase Realtime Database

Web dashboard built with Flask to visualize alerts

Attack detection — port scans, brute force, suspicious connections

Tamper-proof logs with timestamps
